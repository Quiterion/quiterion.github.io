## About Me

Hi! I'm Jamie - a 22-year-old software engineer based in Sydney, currently building distributed systems at TikTok. Iâ€™m passionate about decomposing complex systems and uncovering the hidden mechanics behind how things work.

### Interests
- Mechanistic Interpretability
  - Exploring model diffing, circuit discovery, and alignment-focused downstream applications.

- Retro Science Fiction
  - Immersed in works by Ursula K. Le Guin, Iain M. Banks, Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke.

- Anthropology & Sociology
  - Interested in Proto-Indo-European studies, human evolutionary history, and postmodernist perspectives.

If you share an interest in any of these areas, please feel free to connect!
